# 📘 OOPS in Java – Coursework Repository

Welcome to my Java coursework repository! This project is part of my academic curriculum for the subject **Object-Oriented Programming using Java (OOPS)**. It includes basic Java programs that demonstrate key OOPS concepts, all written and run using **Notepad** and **Command Prompt (CMD)** — proving that you don't need an IDE to get started with Java.

## 📚 What You'll Find in This Repository

This repository contains Java source files (`.java`) illustrating foundational OOPS concepts:

- ✅ Classes and Objects
- ✅ Constructors
- ✅ Inheritance
- ✅ Polymorphism
- ✅ Abstraction and Interfaces
- ✅ Encapsulation
- ✅ Method Overloading and Overriding

Each concept is explained through simple, beginner-friendly examples.

## 💻 How to Run the Java Code using Notepad + CMD

You don't need an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ to run Java. Here’s how you can do it manually:

---

### 📝 Step 1: Write the Code in Notepad

1. Open **Notepad**.
2. Copy any Java code from this repository.
3. Save it with a `.java` extension.
   - Example: `InheritanceDemo.java`
4. **Important:** The filename must match the `public class` name inside the file.

> ✅ While saving, choose "All Files" under **Save as type** and ensure the extension is `.java`.

### 💻 Step 2: Open Command Prompt (CMD)

1. Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
2. Navigate to the folder where your `.java` file is saved:
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Users\YourName\Desktop"

### 🛠️ Step 3: Compile the Java Program

Make sure the Java JDK is installed and added to your system's PATH variable.

To compile your `.java` file, use the `javac` (Java Compiler) command in Command Prompt:

      javac YourFileName.java

📌 Note: Replace YourFileName.java with the actual file name (it must match the public class name inside the file).

If there are no errors, this will generate a .class file in the same folder.

### 🚀 Step 4: Run the Java Program

Once your code is successfully compiled, you can run the Java program using the `java` command.

```bash
java YourFileName
